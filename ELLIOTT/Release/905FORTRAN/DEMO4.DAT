C  CASE STUDY 3
C  COLUMN DESIGN - MODIFIED VERSION
C
C
C  TENR IS ALWAYS A WHOLE NUMBER IN THIS VERSION, AND WHOLE NUMBERS
C  OF THIS SIZE ARE REPRESENTED EXACTLY IN THE COMPUTER USED.
C  THEREFORE ERRORS DO NOT ACCUMULATE.  TENR IS DIVIDE DBY 10
C  TO SET THE VALUE OF R.
C
C
C  GIVE TENR ITS INITIAL VALUE - THIS STATEMENT IS NOT REPEATED
      TENR = 200.0
C
C  DIVIDE BY 10.0 TO GET VALUE OF R - PROGRAM REPEAST FROM HERE
   10 R = TENR / 10.0
C
C  CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO FORMULAS
      IF ( R .LT. 120.0 ) S = 1.7E4 - 0.485 * R * R
      IF ( R .GE. 120.0 ) S = 1.8E4 / (1.0 + R * R / 1.8E4)
C
C  WRITE VALUES OF R AND S
      WRITE (3, 101) R, S
  101 FORMAT (F10.4, 1PE15.3)
C
C  TEST FOR COMPLETION
      IF ( R .GE. 200.0 ) STOP
C
C  INCREMENT TENR
      TENR = TENR + 1.0
C
C  GO AROUND AGAIN
      GO TO 10
      END
